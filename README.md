# Angular Tutorial
Welcome to this Angular tutorial! Today we're going to go over some of the basics of this front end framework. Angular is typically used for web-apps that are a little more interactive than a blog but less heavy than a social media application. A happy medium for Angular would be a single page application with some neat functionality which is exactly what we'll be doing today.

## Prerequisites
* Prior to this tutorial please install a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I recommend Sublime because it's very lightweight and easy to use but I recommend Atom because it has a nice integration with Github and you can download packages to make it feel like an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
